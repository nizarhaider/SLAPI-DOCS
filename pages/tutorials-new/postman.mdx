## Using SLAPI with Postman

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use the SLAPI Indicators API in Postman, a popular API testing and development tool. We'll cover the steps to make requests to the API endpoints and handle responses within the Postman environment.

### Step 1: Install Postman

If you haven't already installed Postman, you can download it from the official website: [Postman Download Page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner to open the "Manage Environments" window.
3. Click on "Add" to create a new environment.
4. Name your environment (e.g., SLAPI Environment).
5. Add variables for the base URL and any authentication tokens required for your API.
   - For example:
     - base_url: `https://yugprc1adf.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slapi_indicators`
     - collection_name: `str`.
     - date: `%Y-%m-%d`
6. Click "Add" to save the environment.

### Step 3: Make API Requests

1. In the Postman workspace, click on the "+" icon to create a new request.
2. Choose the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
3. Enter the API endpoint URL. You can use the base URL along with the endpoint path and any necessary query parameters.
4. If necessary, fill in any required parameters in the request (e.g., `collection_name`, `date`).
5. Ensure the correct environment is selected from the top-right dropdown menu.
6. Click the "Send" button to make the API request.


### Step 4: Handle Responses

1. After sending the request, you'll see the response in the main panel below.
2. Check the response status code to ensure the request was successful.
3. Review the response body to see the data returned by the API.
4. Use Postman's features to format, save, or export the response data as needed.

### Step 5: Test Other Endpoints

Repeat steps 3 and 4 to test other endpoints provided by the SLAPI Indicators API. Explore different requests and parameters to retrieve the desired data from the API.
Here are some examples:
- collection_name
    - inflation
    - land_inflation
    - tourists
- date
    - %Y-%m-%d
