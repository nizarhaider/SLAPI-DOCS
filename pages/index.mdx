## Introduction

The SLAPI Indicators API allows users to retrieve data on various economic and social metrics in Sri Lanka. At present, the API provides monthly data on inflation, land inflation, and tourist arrival numbers. However, the dataset is continuously expanding, and more frequent data will be added soon.

### Base URL

The base URL for accessing the SLAPI Indicators API is:

```
https://yugprc1adf.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slapi_indicators
```

### Usage

To use the SLAPI Indicators API, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Data Collection**: Decide which data collection you want to retrieve data from. Currently available collections include:
   - Inflation
   - Land Inflation
   - Tourist Arrivals

2. **Construct the API Request**: Append the `collection_name` query parameter to the base URL to specify the desired data collection. Additionally, include the `date` parameter to filter data based on a specific date. For example:
   ```
   https://yugprc1adf.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slapi_indicators?collection_name=inflation&date=2022-01-01
   ```

3. **Send the API Request**: Make a GET request to the constructed URL to retrieve the data.

### Example

For example, to retrieve data on inflation, you can make the following API request:

```
   https://yugprc1adf.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slapi_indicators
   ?collection_name=inflation
   &date=2022-01-01
```

The response will contain an array of objects, each representing an indicator with its corresponding value and date.
```
[
  {
    "Inflation": 131.7,
    "date": "2022-01-01"
  },
  {
    "Inflation": 132.9,
    "date": "2022-02-01"
  },
  {
    "Inflation": 137.3,
    "date": "2022-03-01"
  },
  {
    "Inflation": 151.7,
    "date": "2022-04-01"
  }
]
```
