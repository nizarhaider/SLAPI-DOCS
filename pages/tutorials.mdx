Welcome to the SLAPI tutorials section! Here you'll find step-by-step guides and examples to help you get started with using the SLAPI (Sri Lanka API) to access economic and social indicators data from Sri Lanka.

## Using SLAPI with Python

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use the SLAPI (Sri Lanka API) to access economic and social indicators data from Sri Lanka using the Python Requests library.

### Step 1: Get Requests Library

If you haven't already installed the Requests library, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Import the package

```
import requests
```
### Step 2: Make API Requests

First, set the base URL

```
base_url = "https://yugprc1adf.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slapi_indicators"
```

Now, construct the API request URL for the desired endpoint. For example, to retrieve data for the "inflation" collection:

```
collection_name = "inflation"
date = "2022-01-01"  # Specify the date for filtering
url = f"{base_url}?collection_name={collection_name}&date={date}"

```

Then, make a GET request to the API endpoint:

```
response = requests.get(url)
```

### Step 3: Handle the Response

Check the status code of the response to ensure the request was successful. If successful, handle the response data accordingly:

```
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Data retrieved successfully:")
    print(data)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data. Status code:", response.status_code)
```

Your output should look something like:
```
Data retrieved successfully: 
[
    {
    “Inflation”: 131.7,
    “date”: “2022-01-01”
    },
    {
    “Inflation”: 132.9,
    “date”: “2022-02-01”
    },
    {
    “Inflation”: 137.3,
    “date”: “2022-03-01”
    },
    {
    “Inflation”: 151.7,
    “date”: “2022-04-01”
    }
]
```



## Using SLAPI with Postman

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use the SLAPI Indicators API in Postman, a popular API testing and development tool. We'll cover the steps to make requests to the API endpoints and handle responses within the Postman environment.

### Step 1: Install Postman

If you haven't already installed Postman, you can download it from the official website: [Postman Download Page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner to open the "Manage Environments" window.
3. Click on "Add" to create a new environment.
4. Name your environment (e.g., SLAPI Environment).
5. Add variables for the base URL and any authentication tokens required for your API.
   - For example:
     - base_url: `https://yugprc1adf.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slapi_indicators`
     - collection_name: `str`.
     - date: `%Y-%m-%d`
6. Click "Add" to save the environment.

### Step 3: Make API Requests

1. In the Postman workspace, click on the "+" icon to create a new request.
2. Choose the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
3. Enter the API endpoint URL. You can use the base URL along with the endpoint path and any necessary query parameters.
4. If necessary, fill in any required parameters in the request (e.g., `collection_name`, `date`).
5. Ensure the correct environment is selected from the top-right dropdown menu.
6. Click the "Send" button to make the API request.


### Step 4: Handle Responses

1. After sending the request, you'll see the response in the main panel below.
2. Check the response status code to ensure the request was successful.
3. Review the response body to see the data returned by the API.
4. Use Postman's features to format, save, or export the response data as needed.

### Step 5: Test Other Endpoints

Repeat steps 3 and 4 to test other endpoints provided by the SLAPI Indicators API. Explore different requests and parameters to retrieve the desired data from the API.
Here are some examples:
- collection_name
    - inflation
    - land_inflation
    - tourists
- date
    - %Y-%m-%d


## Using SLAPI with RapidAPI

SLAPI is available on RapidAPI, a platform that allows developers to discover, test, and connect to APIs quickly and easily. Follow these steps to start using SLAPI through RapidAPI:

1. **Sign Up for RapidAPI**: If you haven't already, sign up for a RapidAPI account. It's free to join and provides access to thousands of APIs.

2. **Explore the SLAPI Listing**: Visit the SLAPI listing on RapidAPI by following [this link](https://rapidapi.com/nizarhaider/api/slapi1).

3. **Subscribe to the API**: Subscribe to the SLAPI on RapidAPI to gain access to its endpoints and documentation.

4. **Test Endpoints**: Once subscribed, you can test the API endpoints directly within the RapidAPI interface. Use the provided parameters and sample requests to explore the data available through SLAPI.

5. **Integrate into Your Application**: After testing, integrate SLAPI into your application by using the provided API keys and making requests to the endpoints as needed.

6. **Explore Documentation**: Refer to the detailed documentation available on RapidAPI for information on available endpoints, parameters, and response formats.
