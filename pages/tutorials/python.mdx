## Using SLAPI with Python

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use the SLAPI (Sri Lanka API) to access economic and social indicators data from Sri Lanka using the Python Requests library.

### Step 1: Get Requests Library

If you haven't already installed the Requests library, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Import the package

```
import requests
```
### Step 2: Make API Requests

First, set the base URL

```
base_url = "https://yugprc1adf.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slapi_indicators"
```

Now, construct the API request URL for the desired endpoint. For example, to retrieve data for the "inflation" collection:

```
collection_name = "inflation"
date = "2022-01-01"  # Specify the date for filtering
url = f"{base_url}?collection_name={collection_name}&date={date}"

```

Then, make a GET request to the API endpoint:

```
response = requests.get(url)
```

### Step 3: Handle the Response

Check the status code of the response to ensure the request was successful. If successful, handle the response data accordingly:

```
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Data retrieved successfully:")
    print(data)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data. Status code:", response.status_code)
```

Your output should look something like:
```
Data retrieved successfully: 
[
    {
    “Inflation”: 131.7,
    “date”: “2022-01-01”
    },
    {
    “Inflation”: 132.9,
    “date”: “2022-02-01”
    },
    {
    “Inflation”: 137.3,
    “date”: “2022-03-01”
    },
    {
    “Inflation”: 151.7,
    “date”: “2022-04-01”
    }
]
```
